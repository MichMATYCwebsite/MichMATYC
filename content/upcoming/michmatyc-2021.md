Mark your calendars for this year's MichMATYC Virtual Conference on Saturday, October 9, 2021. This year's conference is going to be fantastic! The theme for the conference is Mathematics Support and Success: A Vision for the Future, which combines academic and support services that empowers our students to become the next generation of leaders and changemakers!<br>

Following a year hiatus due to the pandemic, we look forward to you joining us for another excellent MichMATYC Conference! You’ll be inspired by the outstanding presentations and re-energized by spending time with colleagues and friends from around the state and region.<br>

We are a truly special organization, and it is exciting when we can come together – even remotely during a pandemic – to share ideas, learn new teaching strategies, and bring an excitement and passion for teaching mathematics to our classrooms. Share the news with your colleagues so that collectively and collaboratively, we may continue to forge forward to help our students attain their educational, career, and personal goals.<br>

Thank you to the MichMATYC Executive Board and Rodger Irish, for their assistance and support in transitioning this year to a virtual conference. We also would like to thank each of our sponsors for this year's conference!
