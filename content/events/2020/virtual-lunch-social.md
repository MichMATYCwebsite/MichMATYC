The <b>Alliance for Michigan Inquiry Based Learning (IBL)</b> initiative is a series of (virtual) lunch socials where we chat about pedagogy, share tips and resources, and de-stress with a friendly bunch of colleagues. Our next social will be on <b>January 26, 2021</b> at <b>1:00 pm Eastern</b> and will be held on the platform <b>Gather.Town</b> (https://gather.town/app/gjIsk07K0ziPHqbP/lunch) (Password: lunch). All instructors are welcome!
