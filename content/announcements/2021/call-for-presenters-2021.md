Proposals are now being accepted to present during the **2021 MichMATYC Conference** through **April 1, 2021**. This year's conference is hosted by **Lansing Community College** on **October 8-9** with the theme **<i>Mathematics Support and Success: A Vision for the Future</i>**. What makes each of our conferences great are the wonderful presentations and great host college each year!<br/>

There are several presentation formats to choose from regarding your proposal. We have the traditional 45-minute presentation during a break-out session. However, we also have options for presenting a workshop, panel discussion, commercial vendor presentation, or at our inaugural 
Ignite! session.<br/>

If you have done one of the following, then you are in a key position to present at this year’s conference:
<ul><li>Attended a great presentation or workshop,</li>
<li>Implemented a new course or different version of a course previously taught,</li>
<li>Used innovative teaching/learning techniques,</li>
<li>Introducing and evaluating critical thinking in the classroom,</li>
<li>Participated in discussions/debates related to teaching mathematics</li>
<li>Share a topic that will enrich our understanding in a field of mathematics,</li>
<li>Discuss how you implemented AMATYC Impact Live standards in your classroom.</li></ul>

We are planning to have **four 45-minute break-out sessions** during the conference. If you are interested in leading a break-out session, we want to hear from you. Some of the ideas for break-out sessions include:
<ul><li>Math Pathways</li>
<li>Corequisite Courses</li>
<li>Critical Thinking in the Classroom</li>
<li>Student Success Strategies</li>
<li>Equity and Justice</li>
<li>Best Practices for Teaching Online</li></ul>

These are ideas for the sessions. If you have other topics you would like to address, please feel free to submit those as well. We would love to hear your ideas! During this year’s conference, we are also hosting the **inaugural Ignite! session** with all presenters having exactly five minutes to present their topic. If you have attended AMATYC Ignite!, then you know that it is one of the highlights of the conference.<br/>

The review of proposals will begin immediately after the **April 1, 2021 deadline**. Letters of invitation to present at the conference are expected to be emailed in May.
We are looking so forward to seeing everyone at the conference in Lansing later this year!
