#### Edfinity Award Opportunity for Educators

<i class="far fa-calendar-alt" style="margin-right: 5px;"></i><i>Sep 15, 2019</i>

Edfinity and MichMATYC wish to recognize an educator who has made substantial efforts to further the cause of equitable access to 
high-quality homework and/or course materials in mathematics.

The award is supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) Award #1758301 titled "Edfinity Award for Technology-enabled Innovation 
in Improving Student Access to Quality Learning Resources" does not require the work product or outcome to be OER-based - it only requires it to be an innovative alternative to expensive commercial publisher offerings - one that bears the potential for increasing equitable access at scale. Ideally, the effort should have been independently validated to some degree through classroom adoption or usage. The awardee will be selected by the MichMATYC Executive Board at its discretion and the award will be administered during the 2019 Conference at Henry Ford College. The award includes a cash disbursement of $300.

Educators are invited to apply to MichMATYC to be considered for the award. Please <a href="https://edfinity.us/michmatyc/">fill out the form</a> and it will be forwarded to the MichMATYC Executive Board for consideration.

If you have any questions, please reach out to <a href="mailto:sbazzi@hfcc.edu">Sam Bazzi</a>.<br><br>
