We are still accepting proposals to present at this year's <b>MichMATYC Conference</b> hosted at <b>Lansing Community College</b> on <b>October 2-3</b>. The LCC Conference Planning Team has been very busy to provide another wonderful conference and professional development this fall. <b>Thank you</b> for those that have submitted their proposals to present! However, we are <b>still in need</b> of presentation proposals to layout this year's conference program and the <b>deadline is just a month away!</b><br>

We are going to have <b>four 45-minute breakout sessions</b> at the conference. If you are interested in presenting during a session, please let us know by completing a [presentation proposal form](http://bit.ly/michmatyc_proposal). Some of the ideas for the Breakout Sessions in past years have been:

<ul>
<li>Math Pathways</li>
<li>Corequisite Courses</li>
<li>Critical Thinking in the Classroom</li>
<li>Student Success Strategies</li>
<li>Equity and Justice</li>
<li>Best Practices for Teaching Online</li>
</ul>

If you have other topics you would like to present, please feel free to submit them. We would like to hear your ideas. We will also be hosting the inaugural <b>Ignite session</b> with all presenters having exactly five minutes to present their topic.

Whether it be a 45-minute session, workshop, round-table discussion, or Ignite talk, please consider submitting a [presentation proposal](http://bit.ly/michmatyc_proposal) for this year's conference by <b>April 30</b>! The conference promises to be another great opportunity for us to learn and network with our colleagues from across the state.
