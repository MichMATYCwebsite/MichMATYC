For these leadership positions, MichMATYC uses a two-year cycle where the term of office for the President is two years and that person serves as President-Elect for one year prior, and Past President for one year following their term. The Secretary/Treasurer office is a two-year term.<br><br>

Past President Anna Cox (coxa@kellogg.edu) is the chair of the Nominations Committee along with members Maria Johnson (johns257@star.lcc.edu) and Jonathan Benefiel (jbenefiel24@gmail.com). If you are interested in running for either position or want to nominate a colleague that might be interested, please contact any committee member by April 6, 2020.<br><br>
