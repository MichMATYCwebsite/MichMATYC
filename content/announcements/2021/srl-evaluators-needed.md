title = "Evaluators Needed for the AMATYC Student Research League"

+++
From March 12-29, the **4th AMATYC Student Research League** competition will be held. The competition requires groups of 1-3 students to perform research and to solve an open-ended question requiring mathematics. Students will defend their thesis in a formal paper.<br/>

The papers will be evaluated at multiple levels, but AMATYC needs your help in recruiting people for the first level of evaluation. Evaluators will review theses from all over the AMATYC Midwest region consisting of Ohio, Kentucky, Michigan, Wisconsin, Indiana, and Illinois. It is a wonderful opportunity to see what great students we have all over our state and region competing in the Student Research League.<br/>

As a Student Research League evaluator, you will be given the rubric that the final evaluators will be using, but you will not have to fill it out (<a href="https://458rl1jp.r.us-east-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Famatyc.org%2Fpage%2FSRLEvaluationProcess/1/01000176d3766bd3-49d091e6-1db1-432e-97ec-b208ad8208c9-000000/G3fDghUxUz6bPngQmzbJTCxd8bE=195">Evaluation Process link</a>). You will simply be asked to comment on what the strong components of the entry are and what areas could use improvement. You will then give an overall rating of A, B, or C.<br/>

You will be given the entries that you will be evaluating by April 15. You will have until June 15 to complete the evaluations. AMATYC will try to limit the number of entries that you would need to evaluate to around a half dozen or so, but until they find out how many entries are in the AMATYC Midwest region, the exact number is uncertain. AMATYC will work with the volunteers so that no one is overwhelmed with too many entries to evaluate.<br/>

Evaluators of the Student Research League will be acknowledged with a letter from AMATYC, which may be useful for faculty promotion purposes.
