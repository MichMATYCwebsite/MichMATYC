The strength of MichMATYC is the membership and your membership makes a statement. It tells others that your profession is important to you and that you want to be a part of its growth and direction in the state of Michigan. The organization offers you an opportunity to join with other individuals who are interested in mathematics education at the two-year college level.

Why should you become a MichMATYC member? The individual membership includes the following benefits:

<ul>
  <li>A subscription to <i><a href="http://michmatyc.org/newsletter/">The Sum-Times</a></i>. An electronic newsletter that published three times annually, <i>The Sum-Times</i> informs two-year college mathematics faculty about items of state and regional interest,</li>
  <li>Early registration for MichMATYC <a href="http://michmatyc.org/webinars/">webinars</a>. If you cannot attend the live webinar, you can visit the archive to view recordings of all previous webinars on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf3HJfTptOtWPAkrJI2AoPg?">YouTube channel</a>,</li>
  <li>Opportunities for involvement in <a href="http://michmatyc.org/grants/">grants and research</a> focused on the mathematics taught in the first two years of college,</li>
  <li>Chances to engage through the MichMATYC <a href="http://michmatyc.org/miteam">MiTEAM Program</a>,</li>
  <li><a href="http://michmatyc.org/scholarships">Scholarship</a> and <a href="http://michmatyc.org/teachingexcellence">Teaching Excellence Award</a> opportunities, many of which are offered through support from membership dues,</li>

  <li>The right to vote, hold elected office, be appointed to leadership positions, nominate candidates for office, and serve on committees.</li>
  </ul>

We would like to develop a strong organization involving faculty and staff from all community college campuses in the state, and others from four-year campuses that have an interest in mathematics education in the first two years of college.<br><br>
