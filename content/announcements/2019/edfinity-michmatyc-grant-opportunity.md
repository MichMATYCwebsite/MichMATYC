Edfinity and MichMATYC wish to recognize an educator who has made substantial efforts to further the cause of equitable access to 
high-quality homework and/or course materials in mathematics.

The award is supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) Award #1758301 titled <b>"Edfinity Award for Technology-enabled 
Innovation in Improving Student Access to Quality Learning Resources"</b> does not require the work product or outcome to be 
OER-based - it only requires it to be an innovative alternative to expensive commercial publisher offerings - one that bears the 
potential for increasing equitable access at scale. Ideally, the effort should have been independently validated to some degree 
through classroom adoption or usage. The awardee will be selected by the MichMATYC Executive Board at its discretion and the award, 
which includes a cash disbursement of $300.

Educators are invited to apply to MichMATYC to be considered for the award. Please <a href="https://edfinity.us/michmatyc/">fill out the form</a> 
and it will be forwarded to the MichMATYC Executive Board for consideration. <b>The deadline for consideration is Sunday, December 15.</b>

If you have any questions, please reach out to <a href="mailto:sbazzi@hfcc.edu">Sam Bazzi</a>.
