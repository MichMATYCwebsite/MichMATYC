You are invited to participate in a **free workshop** on **Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL)**, taking place at **University of Michigan**, **August 27-29**. Facilitators are Nina White (UM) and Kyle Petersen (DePaul). The [registration form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfzyp7B4CtMyN0uGWoe5ICT-bBX3MeU5-LsWsgW7jCFL4OLNg/viewform?fbclid=IwAR1fL7rlhjuTwy4KF9fGm5LyUi9fSHXa3TGWI8tzBdFGvDQG3mlWcikdTks)
is now up!<!--more-->

The workshop will run approximately from 1:00-5:00 pm, Tuesday-Thursday, August 27-29 on the University of Michigan Campus.

The workshop is appropriate for many levels of experience and interest in IBL teaching—whether you’ve taught IBL for years, 
or are simply looking for small ways to make your classroom more interactive and exploratory. During the workshop participants will:

<ul>
  <li>Watch and reflect upon on selected video clips,</li>
  <li>Discuss key facets of IBL teaching,</li>
  <li>Read and discuss some of the education literature</li>
  <li>Discuss challenges of IBL teaching and strategies,</li>
  <li>Make concrete plans for creating a classroom climate,</li>
  <li>Have coffee and cookies with fellow participants;</li>

  <li>And, if time allows, take part in an IBL lesson!</li></ul>

While the term IBL (inquiry-based learning) is intentionally "big tent" and refers to a wide range of pedagogies that invite 
students to collaborate on rich mathematical tasks, we'll take the view in this workshop that there are four pillars of IBL 
teaching to help us define our focus:

<ul>
  <li>Student engagement in meaningful mathematics,</li>
  <li>Student collaboration for sense making,</li>
  <li>Instructor inquiry into student thinking, and</li> 
  <li>Equitable instructional practice to include all in rigorous mathematical learning and mathematical identity building.</li></ul>
