As I am sure you know the 46th Annual AMATYC Conference in Spokane, Washington will be happening <b>November 12-15, 2020</b> and <b>the 
deadline to submit proposals to present at the conference is rapidly approaching.</b></br>

If you are unfamiliar with Spokane let me tell you just a few reasons why it is a <b>GREAT</b> place to have an AMATYC conference:
<ol>
<li>There are direct flights from 17 cities in the United States and numerous more 1 stop flights. The airport is a short 10-15 minute drive (8 miles) from the convention center.</li>
<li>There are 80-100 restaurants within 0.5 miles from the convention center. Being in the Northwest, we are also into wine, beer, and coffee. Spokane has about 12-14 wine tasting rooms downtown and numerous local breweries and boutique coffee shops. All of this is within easy walking distance from the convention center and hotels. Or you could use our fabulous public transportation system!</li>
<li>With Riverfront Park, First Interstate Center for the Arts, Spokane Arena,  The Historic Art Deco Fox Theatre, River Park Square shopping, museums, and 4 local universities there are certain to be lots of entertainment options for your enjoyment while at the conference.</li>
<li>The rate for the conference hotels is only $142 per night and they are quite luxurious. Check them out [here](https://cdn.ymaws.com/amatyc.site-ym.com/resource/resmgr/2020_spokane_conference/spokane_hotel_information.pdf).</li>
<li>As always at AMATYC there are great sessions, talks, panels and poster sessions  that help us all do the best possible jobs for our students!</li></ol>

Ah, but it is this last point where AMATYC needs your help. Why not share your great idea and vision for the future of mathematics at 
the conference? There are lots of different ways to present your idea - a session, mini-session, workshop, chat and chew table talk, 
poster session. <b>The deadline to register as a presenter for the 46th Annual AMATYC Conference is February 1, 2020</b>. 
Fortunately it so easy to register for a presentation that even a Sasquatch can do it and this [helpful video](https://youtu.be/ZKxSmpy-TUs) shows you how.</br>

I hope to see you all at the 46th Annual AMATYC Conference in Spokane!</br>
