Math in Action: Call for Presenters 
Saturday, February 26, 2022
Grand Valley State University - Allendale Campus

**What is Math in Action?**
Our conference presents lively and informative discussions of current issues in mathematics education while providing an opportunity for practicing Pre-K to 12 teachers, prospective teachers, curriculum directors, and college and university faculty to share ideas, concerns, and resources. We include a keynote and six hour-long sessions with multiple interactive presentations in each session.

**Call for Presenters:** 
We welcome presentation proposals from everyone engaged in improving mathematics teaching and learning. Past presenters have ranged from early-career, first-time speakers to nationally recognized experts. What do you have to share with our community?
