The <b>MichMATYC Sum-Times newsletter</b> is again seeking articles for the <b>May 2020 edition</b>. With the transition of all in-person classes moving to an online format due to the novel coronavirus outbreak, I know that everyone has much to share on their experiences, both your successes and challenges these past four weeks, with our colleagues across the state. I encourage you to write a paragraph that can be included within our popular <i>Campus News</i> section. In addition, if there are upcoming retirements or new hires within your department, a short teaching topic or idea to share, or hints to help other members spend their professional time, please consider writing an article and sending it to the Newsletter Editor.

If you donâ€™t know if something would be appropriate, please ask us. The MichMATYC Sum-Times articles are light, short, and informative. Most of our articles run in length between 300 and 500 words and tend to be one column or two columns per page. As a sample, the [February 2020](https://michmatyc.org/uploads/MichMatycNewsletterFebruary2020.pdf) edition provides a reference for some of our articles, college and campus updates, and upcoming exciting events!

If you are interested in submitting an article or information to be shared with your MichMATYC colleagues in this month's newsletter, please submit to [Desidera (Indah) Kooswinarsinindyah](mailto:Koowinarsinindyahd@macomb.edu), Newsletter Editor, The MichMATYC Sum-Times, by <b>Saturday, April 18</b>.
