Session Description:  Join us for our second sharing session for a focused conversation on assessment in an online environment. What types of assessment have you used while teaching online this semester? Are you using proctored testing to authenticate and monitor learners to minimize academic dishonesty? Can proctored testing in the online environment be the answer? What have you learned this fall about assessment and plan to revise before next semester? Come learn about strategies that our colleagues around the state are using in their online courses for assessment, and successful practices for testing in online courses.
