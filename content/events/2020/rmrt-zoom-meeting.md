Please mark your calendars and share this invitation broadly with your networks:</br></br>

The Right Math at the Right Time (RM@RT) is kicking off a project to ensure the transfer of the entry-level, college-level mathematics courses in each of the three pathways in the Michigan Transfer Agreement (MTA) (quantitative reasoning, introductory statistics, and preparation for calculus). Please join MCSS and RM@RT Leadership for an overview of processes to improve transfer of these courses between community colleges and public and independent bachelor's degree granting institutions. This webinar will provide a guide to resources and will be recorded for those who cannot join live.</br></br>

You are invited to a Zoom meeting.</br></br>
When: Feb 25, 2020 at 4:00 PM &nbsp; Eastern Time (US and Canada)</br></br>
