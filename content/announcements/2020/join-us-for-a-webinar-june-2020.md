<b>MichMATYC</b> and the <b>AMATYC Midwest region</b> is co-sponsoring a webinar on <b>Thursday, June 11</b> at <b>4:00 pm ET</b> with Dr. Jjenna Hupp Andrews on <i>Inclusive Language in the Remote Learning Environment</i>.</br>

<b>Description:</b></br>
Moving to the virtual learning environment presents many challenges. In this session, Dr. Jjenna Hupp Andrews will discuss why using inclusive language in learning environments and communications is so important in any modality being used (online, F2F, Blended, etc.). Maintaining professional and courteous interactions in student-to-student discussions, as well as instructor-to-student communications can not only help create an effective, valuable, and respectful remote learning experience for everyone involved, but it also encourages student interaction and investment in the class because their identities are respected. Dr. Andrews will present not only the research/pedagogy but also the lived experiences of individuals in said groups and the personal classroom experience. Topics will include what defines inclusive/exclusive language, identity-first vs. person-first language, microaggressions, and inclusive language as more than pronouns and gender. This session also encourages questions and interactions by the attendees, so that the discussions can be audience-driven, making it relevant and easily adopted by those attending.</br>
