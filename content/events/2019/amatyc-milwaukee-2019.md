The 45th Annual AMATYC Conference is going to be GREAT! 
The conference is making its debut in Wisconsin, so take advantage of this opportunity to attend an 
awesome national annual conference right here in our region!

Our keynote speakers are [James Tanton](http://www.jamestanton.com) and [Francis Su](https://www.math.hmc.edu/~su/), 
and our featured speakers are [Michael Steele](https://uwm.edu/education/people/steele-michael-d/) and [Alan Zollman](https://www.ius.edu/biographies/index.php/?bioID=161).

The best part of the conference is always the networking â€“ so don't miss this chance to hang out with 
likeminded math professors from all over the country! You'll learn a lot, you'll be inspired, you'll have fun, 
and you'll never want to miss another AMATYC Conference!
