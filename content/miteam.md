The Michigan Mathematical Association of Two-Year Colleges (MichMATYC) provides a mentoring and professional development initiative called MiTEAM (Michigan Teacher Enrichment and Mentoring) for full-time or adjunct faculty teaching mathematics in the first three years of college. The program offers professional development for new mathematics faculty to become more effective teachers and active members within the organization.

### Program Goal

The program's goal is to provide experiences that will help new faculty at two-year colleges in Michigan become more effective teachers and active members of the organization, as well as the broader mathematical community. Participants in MiTEAM will gain knowledge of the culture and mission of the two-year college and its students, acquire familiarity with the scholarship of teaching, commit to continued growth in mathematics, and participate actively in professional societies.

</br>

### MiTEAM Activities and Benefits

Participants selected will attend two consecutive MichMATYC Fall Conferences where they will complete in a program developed for new faculty, including regular conference activities. In the intervening year, participants will be required to develop, implement, and evaluate a project at their home institution.

**First Year**

* MichMATYC Fall Conference
  * Attend four sessions during the conference with presentations specifically for new two-year math faculty,
  * Meet with a mentor to discuss ideas for their development, implementation, and evaluation of a project at the participant’s home institution.
* Between Conferences
  * Communicate with consulting mentor during completion of the project between the first and second years in the program.

**Second Year**

* MichMATYC Fall Conference
  * Attend sessions during the conference according to their interest,
  * Present their MiTEAM project during a break-out session at the conference.

In addition to learning and networking opportunities, participants will receive a one-year membership in MichMATYC for each year of participation and a certificate of completion.

</br>

### Institution Support

The participant’s home institution will be expected to provide support that includes releasing participants from teaching responsibilities to obtain professional development through attendance at the MichMATYC Fall Conference and to help financially support the member’s attendance, if possible, including conference registration, transportation, meals, and overnight accommodations.

</br>

### Application Process

Applications for Cohort 3 will be accepted beginning at the 2018 MichMATYC Conference. All faculty interested in becoming a participant in MiTEAM may [apply online](http://bit.ly/MiTeam). Any questions or concerns regarding MiTEAM may be addressed to [Michael Pemberton](mailto:pembertm@lcc.edu), MiTEAM Coordinator.

The deadline for consideration in **MiTEAM Cohort 3** is **September 1, 2019**.
