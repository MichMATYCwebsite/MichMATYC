#### AMIIBL Offering a Free One-Day Workshop on using IBL in College Mathematics Classrooms

<i class="far fa-calendar-alt" style="margin-right: 5px;"></i><i>May 14, 2020</i>

The <b>Alliance for Michigan Inquiry-Based Learning</b> (<a href="https://www.amiibl.org/">AMIIBL</a>) will be hosting a FREE, 1-day <b>Workshop on using Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL)</b> in college mathematics classrooms on <b>Thursday, June 4</b> at <b>10:00 am ET - 4:00 pm ET</b>. The workshop is appropriate for both new and experienced IBL practitioners with facilitators Danielle Champney (Cal Poly) and Francesca Gandini (Kalamazoo College).</br>

The interactive sessions include creating inquiry-oriented tasks, discussing video examples, and how to do IBL in a virtual classroom.</br>

You can find registration, full description, and facilitator bios below.

<b><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdFBBRrd35lF8lIlRUHhpKP0KE1nfiL0cIFfVUT-NQ3_lKheg/viewform?usp=sf_link">Registration</a></b></br></br>

<b>Description</b></br>
Active learning has been shown to increase student success, which has led to calls by the National Science Foundation and the Conference Board of Mathematical Sciences to move away from the traditional lecturing. It has further been shown that Inquiry-Based Learning
in particular can have a significant and persistent positive impact on undergraduate women in mathematics as well as previously lower-achieving students.</br>

Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL) is a form of active learning in which students engage in the practices of mathematicians: sense-making, proving, example exploration, conjecture-making, revising, listening, sharing, collaborating, persevering, and facing uncertainty. While courses may look different, they rely on four core principles ("pillars‚Äù): Deep Mathematical Thinking, Collaboration, Instructor Inquiry into Student Thinking, and Equity. Following these principles, IBL courses enhance student learning by providing opportunities to
learn math through collaborative struggle, rather than simply watching someone else do it.</br>

This workshop will be appropriate for both new and experienced practitioners of IBL. Sessions may include: video lesson study, an online IBL "classroom" experience, finding/modifying/creating course materials, exploring the nuts and bolts of IBL teaching practices, and thinking about IBL in a distance-learning environment.</br></br>

<b>Facilitators</b></br>
<i>Danielle Champney</i></br>
Dr. Danielle Champney is an Associate Professor at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo, in California. Before she took her current position at Cal Poly, Danielle grew up in Ohio, got her degree in Applied Mathematics at Bowling Green State University, taught community college
for several years in the San Francisco Bay Area, and finished her PhD at UC Berkeley, in Mathematics Education. Now at Cal Poly, Danielle works with faculty teams to provide Inquiry Based Learning workshops to high school and college faculty throughout the
year. She also serves as the Project Director for several partnerships between area school districts and Cal Poly, in which K12 faculty are paired with college faculty, to jointly participate in IBL experiences and transform their teaching.</br>

<i>Francesca Gandini</i></br>
Dr. Francesca Gandini is a visiting assistant professor at Kalamazoo College. Before moving to Kalamazoo, she studied for her Mathematics PhD at the University of Michigan. Her mathematics interests are in algebra, combinatorics, and graph theory. In her time at
the University of Michigan she also developed an interest in mathematics education and obtained a Master in Post-Secondary Science Education. Her interest in IBL peaked when she started attending the annual multi-day IBL workshops at the University of Michigan
and joined the local learning community on inclusive teaching. When she moved to Kalamazoo, she joined the leadership team of AMIIBL, the Alliance of Michigan IBLers, which is now part of an NSF grant for supporting and studying regional IBL communities.</br></br>

### Free IBL Workshop at University of Michigan

<i class="far fa-calendar-alt" style="margin-right: 5px;"></i><i>Aug 1, 2019</i>

You are invited to participate in a **free workshop** on **Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL)**, taking place at **University of Michigan**, **August 27-29**. Facilitators are Nina White (UM) and Kyle Petersen (DePaul). The [registration form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfzyp7B4CtMyN0uGWoe5ICT-bBX3MeU5-LsWsgW7jCFL4OLNg/viewform?fbclid=IwAR1fL7rlhjuTwy4KF9fGm5LyUi9fSHXa3TGWI8tzBdFGvDQG3mlWcikdTks)
is now up!<!--more-->

The workshop will run approximately from 1:00-5:00 pm, Tuesday-Thursday, August 27-29 on the University of Michigan Campus.

The workshop is appropriate for many levels of experience and interest in IBL teaching‚Äîwhether you‚Äôve taught IBL for years, 
or are simply looking for small ways to make your classroom more interactive and exploratory. During the workshop participants will:

<ul>
  <li>Watch and reflect upon on selected video clips,</li>
  <li>Discuss key facets of IBL teaching,</li>
  <li>Read and discuss some of the education literature</li>
  <li>Discuss challenges of IBL teaching and strategies,</li>
  <li>Make concrete plans for creating a classroom climate,</li>
  <li>Have coffee and cookies with fellow participants;</li>

  <li>And, if time allows, take part in an IBL lesson!</li></ul>

While the term IBL (inquiry-based learning) is intentionally "big tent" and refers to a wide range of pedagogies that invite 
students to collaborate on rich mathematical tasks, we'll take the view in this workshop that there are four pillars of IBL 
teaching to help us define our focus:

<ul>
  <li>Student engagement in meaningful mathematics,</li>
  <li>Student collaboration for sense making,</li>
  <li>Instructor inquiry into student thinking, and</li> 
  <li>Equitable instructional practice to include all in rigorous mathematical learning and mathematical identity building.</li></ul>
