### Upcoming Webinars

#### MichMATYC Sharing Session: Discussion Boards and Student Engagement
<i class="far fa-calendar-alt" style="margin-right: 5px;"></i><i>December 8, 2020</i><br/>
Time: 4:00-5:00 pm ET<br/>
Registration: <a href="http://bit.ly/michmatyc_discussboard">Sharing Session - Sign Up</a><br/>
Description: Our next sharing session will consist of focused conversation concerning discussion board topics that engages and motivates math students to participate throughout their learning process. As teaching online or remotely can be a challenge, especially during a pandemic, teachers need more resources to reach all students. Enhancing your face-to-face or online course with online tools, such as discussion boards, can help overcome challenges inherent in remote learning. Join us to learn more about how colleagues around the state are using discussion boards and other online tools to increase student engagement with course materials and with each other.<br/><br/>

#### Interactive Tools for Virtual Teaching
<i class="far fa-calendar-alt" style="margin-right: 5px;"></i><i>January 29, 2021</i><br/>
Time: 2:00-3:00 pm ET<br/>
Registration: <a href="http://bit.ly/michmatyc_virtualteach">Virtual Workshop - Sign Up</a><br/>
Description: In a face-to-face classroom, instructors show an example and then ask students to do a similar problem. Instructors would go around to check if students do it correctly. These interactive tools can help instructors do the same in their virtual classrooms. Instructors can monitor individual or group work and provide feedback to students immediately without go in and out breakrooms. Zoom in to see how to use the following tools: GeoGebra classrooms, MyOpenMath, Jamboards and Google doc in a remote learning environment. Attendees will get a copy of ready-made apps to use immediately. <br/><br/>
