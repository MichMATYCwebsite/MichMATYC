MichMATYC: The Michigan Mathematical Association of Two-Year Colleges was founded to provide a venue for interaction between the mathematics faculties at community colleges across the State of Michigan. Our top priorities are to share ideas, consolidate resources, and plan for the future needs of community college students in the state of Michigan.  In this spirit, MichMATYC is offering a grant of up to $500 to support the activities of its membership, including but not limited to innovative programs, events or projects that will significantly enhance a students' classroom experience or professional development shared among regional institutions.  

##### Eligibility Requirements

Grant recipient must be a member of MichMATYC residing in Michigan; however, the grant recipient need not necessarily have to be a mathematics professor at a two-year college in Michigan.

##### Grant Requirements

Grant is limited to up to $500 and may be used to partially or fully fund a one-time project or start-up costs for a long-term project.  Grantees are required to submit 1-page follow-up/final report after the completion of the project that summarizes the project and next possible steps for involvement by other MichMATYC members.  Grantees will work with the MichMATYC Newsletter Editor to have this report published in the newsletter within 1 year of the completion of the project.  All unused funds must be returned.

We look forward to receiving your ideas.  Please fill out this form and click the Submit button. We’ll evaluate the merits of each proposal and notify all applicants of the decision of whether their grant is to be funded!
