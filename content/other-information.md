### Quantitative Reasoning Courses

In February 2015, MichMATYC member institutions were invited to attend a workshop regarding development of Quantitative Reasoning (QR) courses which are Michigan Transfer Agreement (MTA) compliant. Below are documents from various MichMATYC institutions detailing their efforts in creating these courses.

If you have any questions concerning Quantitative Reasoning Course Development, please contact Jack Rotman at [rotmanj@lcc.edu](mailto:rotmanj@lcc.edu). If you would like your institution's Quantitative Reasoning course materials posted, please send documents and pertinent details to [michmatyc@gmail.com](mailto:michmatyc@gmail.com).

### AMATYC's Student Math League in Michigan

The AMATYC Student Mathematics League (SML) consists of over 190 colleges nationwide. Each year, these schools compete in the Student Mathematics League. The contest consists of two rounds: one in the fall, and another in the winter. Prizes are awarded to the top student and college scorers in the nation. Schools in Michigan compete both regionally in the Midwest Region (including Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, and Wisconsin) and on the national stage.

For more information on the competition, scholarships, and previous exams, please see the [AMATYC Student Mathematics League](http://www.amatyc.org/?page=StudentMathLeague). You can also find the archived results of [Michigan](/uploads/SMLResultsUpdate9.20.15.pdf)'s successes in the AMATYC Student Mathematics League.
