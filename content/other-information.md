### QR Courses

In February 2015, MichMATYC member schools were invted to attend a workshop regarding development of Quantitative Reasoning (QR) courses which are MTA compliant. Below are documents from various MichMATYC institutions detailing their efforts in creating these courses.

If you have any questions concerning QR Course Development, please contact Jack Rotman at [rotmanj@lcc.edu](mailto:rotmanj@lcc.edu). If you would like your institution's QR materials posted to this page, please send documents and pertinent details to webmaster Mark Pelfrey at [mpelfrey@swmich.edu](mailto:mpelfrey@swmich.edu).

### AMATYC's Student Math League in Michigan

The Student Math League (SML) consists of over 190 colleges nationwide. Each year, these schools compete in the Student Math League Contest, sponsored by AMATYC. The contest consists of two rounds: one in the fall, and another in the winter. Prizes are awarded to the top scorers. Schools in Michigan compete both regionally in the Midwest Region (including Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin) and on the national stage.

More information on the Student Math League can be found by [clicking here.](http://www.amatyc.org/?page=StudentMathLeague)
