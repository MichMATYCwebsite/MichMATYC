This is an invitation for you to check out, use, and contribute to [Convergence](http://www.maa.org/press/periodicals/convergence), 
an online MAA resource where history, mathematics, and teaching converge.<br/><!--more-->

Convergence is a free, open-access "onscreen" publication, rather than a typical electronic journal consisting of pdf downloads. 
Since its establishment in 2004, it has provided multi-webpage peer-reviewed articles on the history of mathematics and its uses 
in teaching, as well as an ever-expanding curated collection of materials for infusing some historical perspective into your teaching. 
These materials include hundreds of colorful images, as well as animated and interactive features unavailable in print publications.

Make Convergence your go-to resource for the history of mathematics and its uses in teaching!
