### AMATYC's Student Math League in Michigan

The AMATYC Student Mathematics League (SML) consists of over 190 colleges nationwide. Each year, these schools compete in the Student Mathematics League. The contest consists of two rounds: one in the fall, and another in the winter. Prizes are awarded to the top student and college scorers in the nation. Schools in Michigan compete both regionally in the Midwest Region (including Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, and Wisconsin) and on the national stage.

For more information on the competition, scholarships, and previous exams, please see the [AMATYC Student Mathematics League](http://www.amatyc.org/?page=StudentMathLeague).
