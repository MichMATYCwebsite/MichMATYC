### Quantitative Reasoning Courses

In February 2015, MichMATYC member institutions were invited to attend a workshop regarding development of Quantitative Reasoning (QR) courses which are Michigan Transfer Agreement (MTA) compliant. Below are documents from various MichMATYC institutions detailing their efforts in creating these courses. If you have any questions concerning Quantitative Reasoning Course Development or if you would like your institution's Quantitative Reasoning course materials posted, please send documents and pertinent details to [web@michmatyc.org](mailto:web@michmatyc.org).

### Competitions

#### AMATYC's Student Mathematics League
The AMATYC Student Mathematics League (SML) consists of over 165 colleges in more than thirty-five states, as well as Bermuda, involving 8,000 community college students. Each year, these schools compete in the Student Mathematics League. The contest consists of two rounds: one in the fall, and another in the winter. Prizes are awarded to the top student and college scorers in the nation. Schools in Michigan compete both regionally in the Midwest Region (including Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, and Wisconsin) and on the national stage.

For more information on the competition, scholarships, and previous exams, please see the [AMATYC Student Mathematics League](http://www.amatyc.org/?page=StudentMathLeague). You can also find the archived results of [Michigan](/uploads/SMLResultsUpdate9.20.15.pdf)'s successes in the AMATYC Student Mathematics League.</br>

#### AMATYC's Student Research League
AMATYC has also offered the Student Research League (SRL) as a partnership between two-year college students and Faculty Mentors who are seeking STEM knowledge through an AMATYC approved research program. The Student Research League requires AMATYC Faculty Mentors to sponsor a team of one to three mathematics students from their college to participate in addressing a designed research STEM Challenge Problem. The student(s) have 18 days to complete their task.

For more information on the competition, Faculty Mentor duties and information, and previous competition materials, please see the [AMATYC Student Research League](https://amatyc.site-ym.com/page/StudentResLeague).
