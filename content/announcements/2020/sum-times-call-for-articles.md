+++
The MichMATYC Sum-Times is seeking articles of interest for next month's edition. In addition to our popular <i>Campus News</i> section, if you or your colleagues would like to share accomplishments, recent retirements or new hires within your department, a short teaching topic or idea to share, or hints to help other members spend their professional time, please consider writing an article and sending it to the Newsletter Editor.

If you donâ€™t know if something would be appropriate, please ask us. The MichMATYC Sum-Times articles are light, short, and informative. Most of our articles run in length between 300 and 500 words and tend to be one column or two columns per page. As a sample, the [September 2019](https://michmatyc.org/uploads/MichMatycNewsletterSept2019.pdf) edition provides a reference for some of our great articles, college and campus updates, and upcoming exciting events!

If you are interested in submitting an article or information to be shared with your MichMATYC colleagues in this month's newsletter, please submit to [Desidera (Indah) Kooswinarsinindyah](mailto:Koowinarsinindyahd@macomb.edu), Newsletter Editor, The MichMATYC Sum-Times, by <b>Saturday, February 1</b>.
